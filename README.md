# ResourceAwareMachineLearning
Challenge proposed at the "Resource Aware Machine Learning" school (Dortmund 2017):
predict the position of bins in a warehouse via machine learning algorithms which exploit environmental information (light, antenna power...). The algorithm has to fit the severe memory constraints of the chip mounted on the bin.
